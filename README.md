## Team Git Rules & Best Practices

## 1.	Git Usage Rules
1.Git ignore files (.gitignore) should never be pushed to remote if they contain system-specific or sensitive files.
2.Avoid using `git add .` or adding all files by default. Always add specific files that are required.
3.Always pull the latest changes from the master (or main) branch before starting work on your feature branch using `git pull origin master`.
4.Keep your branch updated regularly to avoid merge conflicts.
5.Never commit build, log, or temporary files.
6.Always check for migration duplication before committing. Ensure no repeated or conflicting migration timestamps.

## 2.	Migration Rules
1.Before creating a new migration, check the existing migrations to ensure no duplicate columns or table creations.
2.Use clear and descriptive names for migrations (e.g., `add_status_to_orders` instead of generic names).
3.Run migrations locally before pushing to verify schema correctness using `rails db:migrate`.
4.Never manually edit existing migrations once pushed to a shared branch.

## 3.	Server Setup Steps
•	Install required Ruby gems using: `bundle install` 
•	Install JavaScript dependencies using: `yarn install` 
•	Create the database: `rails db:create`
•	Run all migrations: `rails db:migrate`
•	Start the Vite development server: `vite dev` 
• Start the Rails server: `rails s`	
	
## 4.	Validation Best Practices
1.Avoid adding validations to every column field by default—it can cause unexpected model-wide issues.
2.Add validations only when necessary, i.e., when the field is required across the model’s workflow.
3.Ensure validation logic matches business requirements and does not break existing data entries.
4.Always test validations with both valid and invalid data before committing.

## 5.	General Best Practices
1.Commit frequently with meaningful commit messages.
2.Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes.
3.Always review your code before creating a pull request.
4.Run the test suite before pushing code to ensure stability.
5.Follow consistent naming conventions for branches (e.g., `feature/add-user-auth`,`bugfix/fix-login-error`).
6.Do not commit secrets, environment variables, or sensitive credentials.
